                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Navigating the ICT Operating Model Dilemma for Telcos</h3>
                        <p class="mb-4">With core connectivity revenues stagnating, telcos are entering the B2B ICT market. Success requires choosing the right operating model to balance leveraging existing assets with the agility needed for innovation.</p>
                        <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Three Operating Models:</h4>
                        <ul class="space-y-2">
                            <li><strong>Integrated Model:</strong> ICT is part of the main telco B2B unit. Leverages brand and customer base but can be slow. Best for emerging markets with low competition. (e.g., Verizon)</li>
                            <li><strong>Leveraged Model:</strong> ICT is a separate legal entity but maintains a coordinated go-to-market strategy. Fosters an entrepreneurial culture but can dilute the brand. Ideal for evolving markets. (e.g., T-Systems by Deutsche Telekom)</li>
                            <li><strong>Independent Model:</strong> Semi-autonomous ICT arm that capitalizes on certain parent resources but operates independently. Best for highly competitive, innovation-driven markets. (e.g., Solutions by STC)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Europe's TMT: The New Growth Engine or Another Lost Decade?</h3>
                        <p class="mb-4">Europe's Technology, Media, and Telecom (TMT) sector has significantly underperformed its global peers. Its share of global TMT market cap has plunged from 30% in 2000 to just 7% in 2023, representing a missed opportunity of **\$8 trillion**.</p>
                        <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Five Key Battlegrounds for a Turnaround:</h4>
                        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 pl-4">
                            <li><strong>Bespoke at Scale (AI & Next-Gen Software):</strong> The largest opportunity, with a projected incremental spend of **\$310 billion** by 2030.</li>
