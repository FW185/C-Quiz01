                <p>In this May edition of our Strategic Insight Report, we continue to compile key updates and insights from the technology and telecommunications industry. We begin with the Global Insights section, featuring an overview of the data center market driven by the growing demand for AI. We also highlight developments in Indiaâ€”one of the most notable 5G success stories. Additionally, we include a report from an external source discussing future technology trends. In the International News section, we present a comprehensive summary of major developments in the global telecommunications landscape, covering leading operators and emerging technologies around the world. Moving to the Domestic Updates, Indonesian operators have made a notable development. First, we provide a news on Telkom group on their performance in the recent period.

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">The Cost of Compute: A \$7 Trillion Race to Scale Data Centres</h3>
                        <p class="mb-4">AI is fuelling a massive demand for compute power, driving billions in infrastructure investment, but future demand remains uncertain. By 2030, data centers globally are projected to require \$6.7 trillion in capital expenditures, with \$5.2 trillion specifically for AI-equipped data centers. Companies face the challenge of balancing rapid capital deployment with prudence due to uncertainty about future AI growth. Overinvestment risks stranding assets, while underinvestment means falling behind.</p>

                            <li><strong>AI is the Centrepiece:</strong> Telcos are using AI for network optimization, customer service, and personalization, with 7% identified as "leaders" in adoption.</li>
                            <li><strong>Focus on B2C Value:</strong> Amid muted ARPU growth (3% CAGR by 2030), telcos are using Fixed-Mobile Convergence (FMC) to reduce churn and enhance loyalty.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rethinking B2B Growth:</strong> While diversifying into ICT, enterprise connectivity still accounts for ~70% of telco B2B revenue.</li>
                            <li><strong>Alternative Connectivity:</strong> Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are showing explosive growth, with FWA connections expected to reach 350 million by 2030.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cost Optimization:</strong> Telcos continue to downsize (14% average FTE decline from 2018-2023), use AI for efficiency, and simplify products to widen margins.</li>
