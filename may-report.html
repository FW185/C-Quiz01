                <p>In this May edition of our Strategic Insight Report, we continue to compile key updates and insights from the technology and telecommunications industry. We begin with the Global Insights section, featuring an overview of the data center market driven by the growing demand for AI. We also highlight developments in Indiaâ€”one of the most notable 5G success stories. Additionally, we include a report from an external source discussing future technology trends. In the International News section, we present a comprehensive summary of major developments in the global telecommunications landscape, covering leading operators and emerging technologies around the world. Moving to the Domestic Updates, Indonesian operators have made a notable development. First, we provide a news on Telkom group on their performance in the recent period. XLSmart, following a recent merger, is now focusing on strengthening its customer network. We also report on the regulator's decision to partner with an Indian company to accelerate 5G and AI development in Indonesia. Finally, we include additional updates from other players and the industry as a whole.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">The Cost of Compute: A $7 Trillion Race to Scale Data Centre</h3>
                        <p class="mb-4">AI is fuelling a massive demand for compute power driving billions in infrastructure investment, but future demand remains uncertain. Compute power, encompassing hardware, processors, memory, storage, and energy, is critical for running AI foundation models and machine learning applications. By 2030, data centers globally are projected to require $6.7 trillion in capital expenditures to meet compute power demand. This includes $5.2 trillion specifically for data centers equipped for AI processing loads and $1.5 trillion for traditional IT applications. This nearly $7 trillion total represents a staggering required outlay by 2030.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">Predicting future compute power demand is challenging due to the rapidly shifting AI sector. Global demand for data center capacity could almost triple by 2030, with about 70 percent driven by AI workloads. This projection hinges on two key uncertainties: the business value of AI use cases and the pace of innovation, which could be offset by Jevons Paradox (where efficiency improvements increase overall demand).</p>

                        <p>McKinsey created three investment scenarios based on different demand levels:</p>

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Signalling the Future: Five Telco Trends in 2025</h3>
                        <p class="mb-4">The telecommunications industry is set for major shifts, driven by five key trends with generative AI as a central force.</p>
                        <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Trend #1: AI is the Centrepiece of Digitalization</h4>
                        <p>Telcos are using AI to boost performance, retention, and marketing. Examples include China Mobile improving network speeds and T-Mobile reducing customer calls by 75% using predictive AI. The telecom industry leads other sectors in AI innovation, with 7% identified as "leaders."</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Trend #2: Focus on Digital Customer Journeys and FMC</h4>
                        <p>Despite growing data demand, telco service revenue has not seen a corresponding increase, with many facing declining ARPU. To counter this, leading telcos are enhancing loyalty through digital experience upgrades and Fixed-Mobile Convergence (FMC). Swisscom, for instance, reduced churn by nearly 18% thanks to FMC.</p>

                        <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Trend #3: To B or Not to B - Telcos Rethink B2B Growth</h4>
                        <p>While enterprise connectivity revenue is growing modestly (3% CAGR by 2028), it still accounts for about 70% of telco B2B revenue. Telcos are exploring non-connectivity services like cloud and cybersecurity, but only a few generate over 50% of B2B revenue from these newer offerings.</p>

                        <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Trend #4: Fixed is Not Fixed Anymore</h4>
                        <p>Alternative connectivity methods like Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are showing explosive growth. FWA connections are expected to grow from 160 million to 350 million by 2030. LEO satellites are also gaining traction for their low latency and cost advantages, especially for backhaul in remote areas.</p>

                        <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Trend #5: Increasing Focus on Cost Optimization</h4>
                        <p>Telcos continue to optimize costs via downsizing (average 14% FTE decline from 2018-2023), AI-driven efficiencies, product simplification, and optimizing sales channels. Direct sales channels have increased to 63% share since 2020, up from 55% previously.</p>
